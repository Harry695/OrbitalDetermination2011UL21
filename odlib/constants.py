    M_IN_AU = 1.496e11
    DAY_IN_GAUSSIAN_DAY = 58.13244087 # Clearly the period is now not in a usual unit like seconds, days, or years. We call this new unit of time the Gaussian day. The Earth's period is 1 year = 2PI Gaussian days. Put another way, 1 Gaussian day is the time it takes for a hypothetical object on a perfectly circular orbit around the Sun with radius of 1 AU to move 1 radian around its orbit.
